# Stock Price Prediction – Predict the Future, Today.

Welcome to a project built with curiosity, passion, and a love for learning.  
This is not just code — it’s a step toward understanding how data and AI can help us see patterns in the stock market.

The model predicts stock prices and shows them compared to actual values on a graph.

## What This Project Is About

This project uses **machine learning** (LSTM model) to predict stock prices based on historical data.

It takes real stock data, processes it, trains a deep learning model, and then makes predictions.  
If you’re new to ML or just curious about the stock market, this is a great place to start.
